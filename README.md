# Musical-instrument-project
A part of school Fablab program

This is a project which I done in my school Fablab Program. My purpose for this task is to create a musical instrument with five different nodes. In order to complete this program, I first built the Ardunio mainboard using CPUs, resistors and capacitors. Welding machine was used to finish this task. Then I used wires, buttons and a buzzer to build the complete curcuit. In order to produce the standard nodes using the buzzer, I did some researches online about the frequency of each nodes. I wrote the code using in the Arduino mainboard later with the data I found during my research.

In order to further improve my musical instrument, I added two more buttons into my equipment. I also changed the code using in the Arduino mainboard which enables the instrument to change its nodes into three different ranges. This improvement makes my musical instrument able to produce 15 nodes instead of 5 nodes. In order to make the instrument better, I should add more buzzers into the circuit in the future which can help it produce different nodes at the same time.
