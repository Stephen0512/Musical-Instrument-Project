# Musical-Instrument-Project

## Project Overview
As part of the school Fablab program, I embarked on a project to create a musical instrument capable of producing five distinct notes. The primary goal was to design and build an electronic instrument using basic components and Arduino technology, enhancing my understanding of electronics, programming, and sound theory.

## Development Process
### Building the Arduino Mainboard
- **Components Used:** CPUs, resistors, and capacitors were the main components.
- **Assembly:** The components were assembled on the Arduino mainboard.
- **Soldering:** A welding machine was utilized to securely solder the components, ensuring robust connections.

### Creating the Circuit
- **Components:** The circuit was built using wires, buttons, and a buzzer.
- **Functionality:** The buttons were used to control the notes played by the buzzer.

### Programming the Arduino
- **Research:** I conducted online research to find the correct frequencies for each of the five notes.
- **Coding:** Using the Arduino IDE, I programmed the mainboard with the frequencies to control the buzzerâ€™s output.

## Enhancements
To further improve the instrument, I made several upgrades:
- **Additional Buttons:** Added two more buttons to increase the musical range.
- **Advanced Programming:** Modified the Arduino code to enable the instrument to switch among three different note ranges, effectively allowing the instrument to produce 15 different notes.

## Future Improvements
- **Multiple Buzzers:** To enrich the sound quality and complexity, adding more buzzers to the circuit will enable simultaneous production of different notes.
- **Complex Sound Patterns:** Incorporate more complex sound patterns and possibly programmable music sequences.
